I joined CNRS in 2019 as a permanent research scientist (*chargé de recherche*).

Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher, first in the group of [Ramin Golestanian] (https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/RaminGolestanian/) (Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford), and then in the group of Olivier Dauchot (Gulliver lab, ESPCI Paris).

I received my PhD from Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie (Paris), under the supervision of Olivier Bénichou and Raphaël Voituriez. My thesis manuscript, entitled "Flucutations and correlations of a driven tracer in a hardcore lattice gas", is available online.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the Physics department of École Normale Supérieure (Paris), where I specialized in statistical physics, soft matter, and hydrodynamics.
