## Nonequilibrium mixtures and active droplets

Our research investigates the physics of **active soft matter systems** and **biomolecular condensates,** with a strong focus on understanding **diffusion and transport** phenomena in complex, nonequilibrium environments.

A significant part of my work explores the diffusion of **tracer particles** within dense mixtures of soft particles, connected to [different thermostats](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.064608) or with [non-reciprocal interactions](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.054606), revealing how activity and crowding affect tracer mobility and challenge classical diffusion theories. I develop analytical frameworks based on linearized density field theories and path-integral methods that accurately describe tracer diffusion in these heterogeneous and active media.

Additionally, using a combination of **microscopic stochastic simulations** and **analytical approaches**, we study how [enzymatic reactions](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsif.2024.0803) and [molecular interactions](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.L023403) govern the formation, stability, and dynamics of chemically active droplets and biomolecular condensates, which play crucial roles in cellular organization.  Additionally, I investigate how chemically active droplets modulate molecular [encounter kinetics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06153), showing that condensates can both accelerate and hinder biochemical reactions depending on the interplay of reaction-driven fluxes and transport limitations. These findings deepen our understanding of transport processes in biologically relevant [crowded and active environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11188), connecting microscopic interactions to emergent nonequilibrium behaviors.

We also aim at advancing our understanding of transport phenomena in **electrolytes** and **chemically active systems** by developing theoretical models that incorporate microscopic fluctuations and solvent effects. We have extended stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) to explicitly account for the [polar nature of solvents](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.268002), enabling the computation of key observables such as charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. This approach highlights how ion–solvent interactions influence the dynamic behavior of electrolytes. In parallel, I have analyzed transport properties in concentrated electrolytes, such as [conductivity and self-diffusion](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/159/16/164105/2918211/On-analytical-theories-for-conductivity-and-self), evaluating recent approximations within SDFT and comparing them with classical theories. This work emphasizes the importance of short-range interactions and hydrodynamic corrections in improving theoretical predictions. 


Additionally, I have explored analogies between **chemotactic particles** and strong electrolytes, showing how nonreciprocal interactions lead to [effective mobility laws](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/160/15/154901/3282879/Chemotactic-particles-as-strong-electrolytes-Debye) that extend Debye-Hückel-type theories to nonequilibrium systems. These results contribute to bridging electrolyte theory and active matter, with potential applications to nanoscale transport in complex environments.


## Stochastic dynamics of interacting particles and tracer diffusion

I have developed theoretical tools to describe fluctuation phenomena in systems of interacting particles, with a focus on stochastic density field theories and the Dean-Kawasaki equation. I derived exact non-Gaussian correlations beyond standard linearized treatments of the Dean-Kawasaki equation and reviewed its foundational role in stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), highlighting connections with frameworks such as fluctuating hydrodynamics and macroscopic fluctuation theory. I also investigated the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles on complex geometries and revealed universal correlation profiles in single-file transport, extending beyond traditional one-dimensional systems. In other studies, I proposed a microscopic theory for absolute negative mobility in crowded active systems and extended linear response theory for driven tracers in the symmetric exclusion process. I further derived an exact closure for spatial correlations in single-file diffusion, providing new insights into the structure of interactions that give rise to anomalous transport. These contributions form a versatile framework for analyzing fluctuations, correlations, and transport in soft and active matter systems.
